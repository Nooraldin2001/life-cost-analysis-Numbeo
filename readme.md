Cost of Living Analysis Project
Overview
This project aims to analyze the cost of living dynamics across various cities and countries using a dataset containing information about different cost components. By examining the data, we gain insights into the factors influencing the cost of living and their implications for individuals and organizations.

Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information on various cost components such as meals, drinks, groceries, transportation, housing, and more. Each row represents a city or country, and each column represents a specific cost component. Additionally, the dataset includes columns for city, country, and salary information.

Analysis Steps
Data Preparation: Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, mapping columns to categories, and aggregating data by city and country.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify trends, patterns, and outliers in the data. Visualize relationships between the cost of living and other factors using scatter plots, heatmaps, and bar charts.

Correlation Analysis: Analyze correlations between the cost of living and other variables such as transportation, housing, and salary. Identify significant correlations and their implications.

Insights and Recommendations: Summarize key insights derived from the analysis and provide recommendations for individuals and organizations based on the findings.

Presentation
The project includes a presentation summarizing the key findings and insights from the analysis. The presentation consists of five slides covering the introduction, cost of living analysis, breakdown of cost components, correlation analysis, and conclusion with recommendations.
